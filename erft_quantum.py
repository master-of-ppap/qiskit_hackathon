    Determines if two quantum circuits, U and V, are equivalent using the
    Equivalence via Randomized Fidelity Testing (ERFT) algorithm.

    Args:
        U: The first quantum circuit.
        V: The second quantum circuit to compare against the first.
        epsilon: The error tolerance for equivalence. The fidelity is checked
                 to be >= 1 - epsilon.
        delta: The probability of the estimation failing (i.e., the estimated
               fidelity being more than epsilon away from the true fidelity).
        seed: Optional seed for the simulator for reproducibility.

    Returns:
